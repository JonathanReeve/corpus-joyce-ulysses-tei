<lb n="151782"/>metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his

<lb n="151803"/>Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a
<lb n="151804"/>total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the

<lb n="154862"/>Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race.
<lb n="154863"/>Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed

<p><lb n="154868"/><stage>(laughs)</stage> Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I.

<p><lb n="154873"/><stage>(tries to laugh)</stage> He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old

<lb n="154883"/><stage>(he laughs)</stage> Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will I give him a lift home?
<lb n="154884"/>Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?</p></sp>

<p><lb n="154896"/>Ah, well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. <stage>(he

<lb n="154910"/>Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at
<lb n="154911"/>Bloom's plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment
<lb n="154912"/>nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute
<lb n="154913"/>mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that
<lb n="154914"/>the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be
<lb n="154915"/>done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is
<lb n="154916"/>exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the
<lb n="154917"/>corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms
<lb n="154918"/>with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher
