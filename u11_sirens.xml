<p><lb n="110081"/>Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair

<p><lb n="110089"/>The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them

<p><lb n="110092"/>Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the <distinct type="nonstandard-compound">teatray</distinct> down to an

<p><lb n="110103"/>On her flower frowning miss Douce said:

<lb n="110107"/><said who="mk">―Take no notice,</said> miss Kennedy rejoined.</p>
<p><lb n="110108"/>She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered
<lb n="110109"/>under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting
<lb n="110110"/>for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two

  <p><lb n="110112"/>Yes, bronze from <distinct type="nonstandard-compound">anear</distinct>, by gold from afar, heard steel from <distinct type="nonstandard-compound">anear</distinct>,

  <p><lb n="110118"/>Miss Douce <distinct type="nonstandard-compound">halfstood</distinct> to see her skin askance in the <distinct type="nonstandard-compound">barmirror</distinct>
    <lb n="110119"/><distinct type="nonstandard-compound">gildedlettered</distinct> where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a

<lb n="110122"/><said who="mk">―Try it with the glycerine,</said> miss Kennedy advised.</p>
<p><lb n="110123"/>Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce
<lb n="110124"/><said who="ld">―Those things only bring out a rash,</said> replied, reseated. <said who="ld">I asked that old

<p><lb n="110126"/>Miss Kennedy, pouring now a <distinct type="nonstandard-compound">fulldrawn</distinct> tea, grimaced and prayed:
<lb n="110127"/><said who="mk">―O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!</said>
<lb n="110128"/><said who="ld">―But wait till I tell you,</said> miss Douce entreated.</p>
<p><lb n="110129"/>Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two

<lb n="110131"/><said who="mk">―No, don't,</said> she cried.
<lb n="110132"/><said who="mk">―I won't listen,</said> she cried.</p>
<p><lb n="110133"/>But Bloom?</p>
  <p><lb n="110134"/>Miss Douce grunted in <distinct type="archaism">snuffy</distinct> fogey's tone:
<lb n="110135"/><said who="ld">―For your what? says he.</said></p>
<p><lb n="110136"/>Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but
<lb n="110137"/>prayed again:
<lb n="110138"/><said who="mk">―Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That

<p><lb n="110140"/>She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.
<lb n="110141"/><said who="ld">―Here he was,</said> miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,

<p><lb n="110143"/>Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss

<lb n="110145"/>a snout in quest.
<lb n="110146"/><said who="mk">―O!</said> shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. <said who="mk">Will you ever forget his goggle eye?</said></p>
<p><lb n="110147"/>Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:

<p><lb n="110149"/>Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. <said who="lb" aloud="false">Why do I always

<p><lb n="110157"/>Of sin.</p>
<p><lb n="110158"/>In a giggling peal young <distinct type="nonstandard-compound">goldbronze</distinct> voices blended, Douce with

<p><lb n="110162"/>Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.</p>
<p><lb n="110163"/>Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and

<p><lb n="110171"/>Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
